          About Mr. Walter Simuyu
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
          Mr. Walter Simuyu is a distinguished teacher of English and Literature,
          celebrated for over a decade of shaping young minds through the power of
          words. His teaching transcends grammar and interpretation — it’s an
          invitation to think deeply, feel profoundly, and express with purpose.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
          Known for his eloquence and storytelling, he transforms literature into
          a living dialogue — one that connects emotion, culture, and intellect.
          His students describe his lessons as journeys through imagination and
          human experience.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
          Beyond the classroom, Mr. Simuyu is a devoted reader, writer, and
          mentor. He believes that language is not merely a subject, but a bridge —
          a way to understand both ourselves and others.
          <span className="block italic mt-3 text-secondary text-lg font-medium">
            “Every great reader becomes, in time, a better thinker and a kinder
            speaker.”
          </span>
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Through this platform, he shares reflections, literary insights, and
          thought pieces that celebrate the beauty of words and the art of human
          connection.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Outside academics, Walter loves exploring new places and connecting with
          nature. He often leads learning adventures where students experience
          literature and history coming alive through cultural visits and discovery.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          He is equally passionate about sports, often mentoring learners on teamwork
          and discipline both on and off the field. His favorite activities include
          football, hiking, and cross-country runs — all of which he believes nurture
          resilience and a sense of community.
